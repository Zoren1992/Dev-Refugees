DJANGO 

* manage.py = script for running administrative task like updating the database structure, adding super users, running the development server etc

* in the folder the same name as your project (e.g = puddle):
    -> asgi.py and wsgi.py = entry points for the web server, it's for when you deploy your project to a live server
    -> setting.py = global configuration for the whole project (SECRECT_KEYS, INSTALL_APPS, TEMPLATES, DATABASE, PASSWORD)
    -> url.py = table of contents for the whole project


* you have to create a foler for the app nameed (base or core), bascially it is the actual app that you're creating. you do that by running startapp (filename):
  -> migrations = info about the database, generated by Django:
    -> admin.py = where we register the database models to be used inside the Django admin interface
    -> apps.py = a configuration file but just for this specific app
    -> model.py = where we define database models, like info about what we want to store for an item eg: title, description, price.
    -> test.py = where we can run automated tests for this app
    -> views.py = where we define views for the app


* 1st breakpoint: 
  we create a core or base file for the app, in there we created a folder called templates and core folder inside of it.
  we then create the html files.
  we then connect those html files to view.py to render all the files.
  we then connect the view.py file to our urls.py file
